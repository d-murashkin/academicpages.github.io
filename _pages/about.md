I am a PhD student at the Institute of Environmental Physics of the University of Bremen, Germany.
I am a part of the [Polar Remote Sensing](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/start/) group led by [Dr. Gunnar Spreen](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/gunnar-spreen/).
Currently I work on remote sensing of sea ice in the Arctic.
For my project I use microwave (Sentinel-1 - Synthetic Aperture Radar), optical (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3) sensors and satellite altimetry (CryoSat-2).
